bool found = found 
while (!found) {
	int x = random(1, 100);
	cout << "?" << x << 
}







// normal - time space              
// interactive - time space and limit on the interactions

input / output
for(int i=0; i<1000; i++){ //0.1 second
	cout << i;              // 0.5 second 
}

cout << 1; //heavy task
c = a + b;

//so printing happens in buffer

for(int i=0; i<1000; i++){ 
	cout << i << "\n";              // faster
}

for(int i=0; i<1000; i++){ 
	cout << i << endl; // slower as it flushes the output every .                    //loop
}


concept of flushing and buffer
=> go through the blog on flushing over buffer
interactive problems are flushed every time.

its hard to test the problem

so let's see how we can code and test it.
